# SierpinskyRandomGenerator

A simple program that generates a Sierpinsky triangle using the RNG-based [Chaos game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game) algorithm. It's mathematically very interesting how a chaotic formula can lead to an ordered image.

Thanks to the recent [Numberphile Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) for inspiring me to make this.

## Configuration

Simply change the values in the generator.properties file to make other shapes and sizes of Sierpinsky triangles.

## Sample image

## Next steps

This is just a first version of the progam. We'll see where it goes from here. :)
